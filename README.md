## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- The GIF was too big, so I decided to compress it in order to be able to upload it t github and it ended up having a weird look, but the program runs perfectly regardless 
- Creating the animations and CSS styles
- Understanding the API I was working with
- Be able to retrieve the right information
- Understand async / await and be able to use them throughout the several functions that needed it
